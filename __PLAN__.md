# Library

- an image is defined by its byte content
- we can compute a hash for that
  must be unique for a large collection
- an image can be
  overwritten
  renamed in the directory (file name)
  moved inside the device or outside
- the path of an image can be altered
- image inode is unchanged when
  overwritten
  renamed
  moved inside
- the device of an image can be
  mounted elsewhere (mount point)
  renamed (label)
- device uuid should be a constant
- thus we can track a image by the pair (device uuid, inode)
  else we can use a hash -> (device uuid, inode) / hash
  else we must add an uuid in the image metadata
- path alias
  - a path can contains a symbolic link
  - a directory entry can be a hard link

NTFS
- inode is file ID
